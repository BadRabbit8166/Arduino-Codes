These Codes are for the Digispark Rev3. In this code the Digispark will emulate a Keyboard and act as a rubberducky,
which is, however, very expensive.
These Codes use the Library DigiKeyboard.h.
DISCLAIMER: These Codes are for education purposes only. They're not supposed to harm anybody and I have no responsobility if they do..
